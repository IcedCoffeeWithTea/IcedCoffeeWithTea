# Intro

Just some lonely introverted programmer.

# What languages do i code in?

I'm mostly proficient in python (as you may see from my repos, most of my projects are written in python) but I don't mind java, javascript, or c++.

# What do i do

I do all kinds of projects im kind of 'jack of all trades' kind of guy, I can be a website devoloper one day and game devoloper the other.
But these days, i've been focusing on network related projects.
